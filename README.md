# legume_vision
Identifies legumes common in Indian cooking using a trained deep learning computer vision model.

 I've always felt confused by the names and appearances of legumes commonly used in cooking (normally when asking my mom for recipies), and so I created this app to help with that. Uses the EfficientNet model and trained on a custom dataset I've created which you can access here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sarveshgade/indian-legumes/data. Currently can identify 5 types of legumes: 'chana_dal_split_chickpea', 'masoor_split_red_lentils', 'moong_mung_bean', 'muth_moth_bean', 'urad_black_gram'.
